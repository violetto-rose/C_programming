// Design and implement C Program to find shortest paths from a given vertex in a weighted connected graph to other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.

/*
Data Structures:

dist[]: Array to store the shortest distance from the source vertex to each vertex.
visited[]: Array to track which vertices have been processed.

Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:

Initialization: Set the distance to the source vertex to 0 and all others to INF. Mark all vertices as unvisited.
Find Minimum Distance: In each iteration, select the vertex with the minimum distance that hasn't been visited yet.
Update Distances: Update the distance of adjacent vertices if a shorter path is found via the current vertex.

Main Function:

The graph matrix represents the adjacency matrix of the graph, where 0 indicates no direct edge between vertices.
dijkstra() function is called with the number of vertices, the graph, and the starting vertex.
